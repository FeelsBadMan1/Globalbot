# Globalbot
A Discordbot that allows you to chat in Servers even if you not being in these Servers
You can use this to setup a Globalchat what means, i the channel where the commands where run all messages will be deleted by the bot and the Bot will return a Embed with the author of the Message, UserID of the Author, Servername it where sent from and more importantly the Message you sent as description. The Bot will send this Embed though all Servers. Currently it is only using json to store the Userdata. Json might be okey but its not a good option if you have lots of users. This is a issure im aware of and i will, if i got time change a bit on the Sourcecode so it works with Database. Both versions json & Database will be shown on this Page if it is done. I will also use Github more and upload new Projects more often then i did so far. If you want to request a new Feature or report a Bug please feel free to open a issure. Otherwise i hope you have a great day and i wish you much fun with my Projects.
